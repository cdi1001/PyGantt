### Installation

The requirements are rather limited and can installed from the requirements file. I recommend using a virtual environment for that:

```sh
# virtualenv setup, recommended
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# actual install for requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# to install dev dependencies too run
# pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
